# jetracer-stick-to-the-wall
## Purpose
This script was created to make the Jetracer platform hold a safe distance from the wall. The aim of the project was to achieve the best loop around the class time.

## Installation
Install the system and configure it according to tutorials on the Waveshare website.
The next step is to move the scan.py into the scripts folder.

## Starting the programme
To run the script, pass the following commands into the separate terminal windows :

 - roscore

 - roslaunch jetracer laser_filter.launch

 - roslaunch jetracer jetracer.launch

 - rosrun jetracer scan.py

After which, the car should start driving alongside the wall on its right-hand side.
